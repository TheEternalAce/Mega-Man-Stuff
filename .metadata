  "description" : "This mod adds stuff from the Mega Man franchise.\nReploids and Carbons as a playable race, with a separate FU/FR compatibility mod.\nPlanned features: Many probably cool things. Unpack the mod to see if you want, though it's not everything.\n\nIf there is anyone willing to make sprites for this mod DM me on Discord @Rockman Zeta#0979. You can send Steam messages, but I will respond faster on Discord.\n\nThanks to Tech Additions by \"gay moth aunt\" for allowing me to use the source code for adding techs to the tech console\nMod here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1131820988\n\nAddon FU/FR Reploid mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2740392011",
