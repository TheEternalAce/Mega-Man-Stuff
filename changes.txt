Changed the basic S.A.I.L. to RiCO from Mega Man X DiVE

Added alternate Mythos X and Zero equipment (X buster and armor, and Zero Saber and armor)
All projectiles have a lifetime of 5 (whatever that means (Seconds? Ticks?) )
Busters (X-Buster and Ion Buster) now overlay over the player's arm
Dyes color the armor and not the black on armors (I don't know how to explain it, see for yourself
EVERY item is now internally prefixed with "megaman_"
-WARNING: Because of this, your character WILL crash for the first load attempt and the items you had from this mod previously WILL be deleted
Many balance changes
-Buster (charged weapons) charge damages reduced

Matched Elite Hunter armor colors with Ion weapon colors
Only Humans, Reploids and Carbons (for now) can craft Reploid equipment

Removed Reploid outfit variants and used vanilla ones instead
Removed Pandora and Prometheus variant Biometal Model W
Reploids can now craft Aegisalt Bow, Aegisalt Pistol, Ferozium Staff, Ferozium Wand, Violium Broadsword and Violium Shortsword (weird oversight but meh)
X Dash and Wall Climb techs are enabled at the start for Reploids
-Therefore Wall Climb tech chip and Tech Console were removed from the starting ship locker inventory for Reploids
-It is still craft-able by any other species, X Dash tech chip is craft-able as well
